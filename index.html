    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! I'm Zihad, a dedicated and enthusiastic Full Stack Web Developer with a strong passion for building interactive, user-friendly, and modern web applications. My journey into web development started with a deep curiosity about how websites work, which soon turned into a serious career path.</p>

<p>I specialize in both frontend and backend technologies. On the frontend, I love working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks to create responsive and visually appealing interfaces. On the backend, I enjoy building robust server-side applications using technologies like Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB or MySQL.</p>

<p>I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and constantly improving my skills by learning new technologies and taking on challenges. My goal is to create digital experiences that not only look great but also perform efficiently and provide real value to users.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about design trends, reading tech blogs, and sometimes helping others learn web development too!</p>
